# COVID-19 SQL Data Exploration

This project showcases an in-depth SQL-based exploration of a COVID-19 dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and demonstrate advanced SQL skills through data cleaning and analysis. Below are the key aspects and insights covered in the project:

## Key Topics Explored

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Checking Null Values: Identified missing values in critical columns to assess data quality.

Deleting Null Values: Removed rows with significant null values to ensure accurate analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Top 10 Countries by Key Metrics:

Identified the top 10 countries based on confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates.

Cases and Deaths Relative to Population:

Analyzed the proportion of cases and deaths per million population to understand the impact on different countries.

### 3. Advanced Analysis

Countries with High Testing Rates but Low Confirmed Cases:

Highlighted countries with efficient testing strategies that led to fewer confirmed cases.

Total Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries by Continent:

Aggregated data to compare the pandemic's impact across continents.

Recovery Rate for Countries and Continents:

Calculated and ranked recovery rates to identify regions managing recoveries effectively.

Active Cases as a Percentage of Total Cases:

Measured active cases as a percentage of total cases to assess ongoing outbreaks.

### 4. Testing Efficiency

Countries with Low Testing but High Confirmed Cases:

Investigated countries with insufficient testing but high case counts, indicating underreporting or late interventions.

Identify Countries with High Fatality Rates:

Highlighted countries with fatality rates above 10% and ranked them by testing rates to explore healthcare challenges.

### 5. Global Insights

Global Situation:

Summarized worldwide COVID-19 metrics, including total cases, deaths, recoveries, and testing rates.
